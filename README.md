# dx2push
Takes a mail message from dxmaps and sends the useful pieces via pushover

## Prerequisites

You'll need to have an account at [pushover.net](https://pushover.net/). You'll also need to either use an existing [pushover app ID or create a new one](https://pushover.net/apps).

Edit dx2push.ini to add your app and user credentials, then copy it to /usr/local/etc (or a similar directory; you'll need to update the code.)
